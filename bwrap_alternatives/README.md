# Alternative Implementation: Isolated Configuration

This alternative implementation (`bcursor_uses_work.sh`) creates a completely isolated environment for Cursor by:

1. **Isolated Home Directory**: Uses `~/.cursor` as the sandboxed home directory instead of sharing the regular Cursor configuration
2. **Project Mounting**: Mounts the current project directory at `/home/app/work` within the sandbox
3. **Complete Isolation**: Provides stronger security isolation by preventing any access to your regular Cursor settings, extensions, and chat history

## Key Differences from Main Implementation

- **Separate Configuration**: All Cursor settings, extensions, and chat history are completely separate from your regular Cursor installation
- **Project Path**: The project is mounted at `/home/app/work` instead of the original path
- **Chat History**: Each project will have its own isolated chat history, preventing confusion between different projects

## Potential Improvement

To further improve project isolation, consider modifying the script to mount projects as `/home/app/work/PROJECT_NAME` instead of just `/home/app/work`. This would ensure that:

- Each project gets its own subdirectory within the sandbox
- Chat histories are completely separated by project name
- Multiple projects can be worked on simultaneously without configuration conflicts
- Better organization of project-specific Cursor data

This approach would be particularly beneficial when working on multiple projects that might have similar file structures or when you want to maintain completely separate AI chat contexts for different projects.
